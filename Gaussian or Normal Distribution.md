The **Gaussian distribution**, also known as the **normal distribution**, is a probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. It is one of the most important distributions in statistics, used in many fields like economics, engineering, and science.
