Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a **dimensionality reduction technique** commonly used in data preprocessing and machine learning to simplify datasets with many features.

Transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while retaining most of the important information, or "variance," in the data. 
**Less prone to overfitting**
**Noise Reduction**


## Example

Assume we have a dataset with the following features collected from customer purchase data:

- **Annual Income**: The annual income of the customer.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned based on the customerâ€™s spending behavior and loyalty.
