Imagine you have a set of data points (e.g., heights of people in a population) that appear to come from different groups or "clusters". A **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** assumes that these data points are generated by a mixture of several **Gaussian distributions** (also known as **normal distributions**) and that each data point belongs to one of these groups.

- **Gaussian distribution**: This is a bell-shaped curve, characterized by its mean (average) and variance (spread). A normal distribution is often used in statistics because many real-world phenomena tend to follow it.
- **Mixture model**: A model that combines multiple distributions. In this case, multiple Gaussian distributions are combined to model complex data.

Let’s say you have a dataset of **heights** of people in a room. Some people are **short** (around 5 feet), some are **tall** (around 6 feet), and some are **average** (around 5.5 feet). These groups of heights can be modeled using a **Gaussian Mixture Model** where each group of heights corresponds to a separate Gaussian distribution.

Now, imagine you don’t know which person belongs to which height group. The EM algorithm will help us estimate the **parameters** (means and variances) of each group, and assign each data point to the most likely group.

### **What Happens After We Apply the EM Algorithm?**

The **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm** helps us estimate the parameters of the Gaussian distributions and assign probabilities (responsibilities) to each data point that it belongs to each distribution. The EM algorithm does this in two main steps:

1. **E-step (Expectation)**: We calculate the probability (responsibility) that each data point belongs to each Gaussian distribution, based on the current estimates of the parameters (mean and variance). This is like saying, "Given what I know so far, what is the probability that this person is short or tall?"
    
2. **M-step (Maximization)**: Based on the probabilities from the E-step, we update the parameters (mean and variance) of each Gaussian distribution. This is like saying, "Now that I know the probability of each person being short or tall, let me update my guess of the average height and spread for each group."

### **Dataset**:

We have the following dataset of heights (in meters): Data=[5.2,5.5,5.8,6.1,5.7,5.6,6.3,5.9,5.6,6.0]\text{Data} = [5.2, 5.5, 5.8, 6.1, 5.7, 5.6, 6.3, 5.9, 5.6, 6.0]Data=[5.2,5.5,5.8,6.1,5.7,5.6,6.3,5.9,5.6,6.0]

We assume that these heights come from two groups:

1. **Group 1 (short people)**
2. **Group 2 (tall people)**

### **Step 1: Initialization**

We will initialize the means and variances for the two groups. Let's assume:

- **Group 1 (short)**: Mean = 5.5, Variance = 0.1
- **Group 2 (tall)**: Mean = 6.0, Variance = 0.1

We will also assume that the two groups have **equal probability**, so the mixing coefficient for each group is 0.5.

### **Step 2: Expectation Step (E-step)**

In the E-step, we calculate the **responsibility** (probability) that each data point belongs to each group. This is done using the **Gaussian probability density function (PDF)**:

For a Gaussian distribution, the PDF for a value x

Let’s calculate the likelihood for each height for both groups. Since we assume the mixture coefficient for both groups is 0.5, the total likelihood for each height is the sum of the likelihoods from both groups weighted by these coefficients.

### **Calculations for E-step**:

#### For Group 1 (short):

- Mean (μ1\mu_1μ1​) = 5.5, Variance (σ12\sigma_1^2σ12​) = 0.1

#### For Group 2 (tall):

- Mean (μ2\mu_2μ2​) = 6.0, Variance (σ22\sigma_2^2σ22​) = 0.1

We calculate the Gaussian PDF for each height for both groups and then compute the responsibilities. However, for simplicity, let's assume we have performed the following calculations using the formula above for each height:

| Height (m) | Group 1 (short) Probability | Group 2 (tall) Probability | Responsibility for Group 1 | Responsibility for Group 2 |

Now, we repeat the E-step and M-step using the updated means, variances, and mixture coefficients. We continue until the parameters converge (i.e., the values stop changing significantly).

#### After a few iterations, the final results might look like:

- **Group 1 (short)**: Mean ≈ 5.56, Variance ≈ 0.09, Mixing Coefficient ≈ 0.49
- **Group 2 (tall)**: Mean ≈ 6.02, Variance ≈ 0.11, Mixing Coefficient ≈ 0.51

### **Conclusion**:

Through the EM algorithm, we have successfully **segmented** the data into two groups (short and tall people), with the following final estimates:

- Group 1 (short people): Mean = 5.56 meters, Variance = 0.09
- Group 2 (tall people): Mean = 6.02 meters, Variance = 0.11
